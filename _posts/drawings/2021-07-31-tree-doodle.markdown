Hello,

This post continues on the topic of doodling, this time with plants and trees.

# Plant and Tree Doodles

Again, I started by taking ideas over the web, and collecting doodles.

# Composition of tree doodles

Now, we can turn those doodles into a unique composition. And voil√†!

# Transforming photos into doodles

We can also browse the web for actual photos of trees and transform them into doodles.
This can be very fun too!
