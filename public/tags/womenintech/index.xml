      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This month, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.onufemmes.fr/&#34;&gt;ONU Femmes France&lt;/a&gt; celebrates a fascinating woman.&#xA;We all know her face, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen her since childhood, but few of us know her name.&#xA;I give you: &lt;strong&gt;Hedy Lamarr&lt;/strong&gt;, the woman who inspired Disney&amp;rsquo;s Snow White.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;hedy-lamarr&#34; src=&#34;https://lilie-artsci.github.io/images/hedy-lamarr.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She was an Austrian actress and movie producer, and was considered the most beautiful woman.&#xA;But the reason I want to talk about her today is that she was also an &lt;strong&gt;inventor&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;Her most famous legacy is a patent called &amp;ldquo;Secret Communications System&amp;rdquo; she filed in 1942 and co-invented with composer George Antheil.&#xA;It consists in the design of a frequency hopping spread spectrum method (FHSS), which she came up with during World War II in a spirit of enabling communication without being eavesdropped or jammed, by switching the frequency on which a signal was being emitted to another frequency in a sequence known by the transmitter and receiver.&#xA;FHSS are know being used in wireless networks, such as Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, October 12, was &lt;strong&gt;Ada Lovelace Day&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;Many other artists shared their illustration of Ada Lovelace, as well as a short biography of her.&#xA;I wanted to share mine as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As many said before me, she was a Mathematician and the first &lt;strong&gt;person&lt;/strong&gt; ever to design a computer program when computers didn&amp;rsquo;t even exist, and at a time&#xA;where it was often believed that women were only interested in &amp;ldquo;futile things&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
