      <description>Hey there,
This month, ONU Femmes France celebrates a fascinating woman. We all know her face, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen her since childhood, but few of us know her name. I give you: Hedy Lamarr, the woman who inspired Disney&amp;rsquo;s Snow White.
She was an Austrian actress and movie producer, and was considered the most beautiful woman. But the reason I want to talk about her today is that she was also an inventor.</description>

      <description>Hey there,
I recently took an online class by Laura McKendry, whose style I love and I find so loose and fresh, and for that class I made a couple of drawings about insects. I discovered how much fun they are to paint or draw!
This first one I painted with watercolor the basic shape I wanted to do, and then I drawed with pencils on top.
In this second one, I tried to paint them walking in different directions and to look more lively :)</description>

      <description>Hey!
Here is a small drawing of my cat, whose favorite posture is to lie on the back.
She&amp;rsquo;s often in that weird mood in-between cuddly and psycho-cat, lying a trap full of claws when we try to pet it :)</description>

      <title>Japanese style characters</title>

      <description>Hi there!
A few months ago, I took the Domestika class &amp;ldquo;Watercolor illustration with Japanese influence&amp;rdquo; by Flor Kaneshiro. It inspired me to design the following characters. For the little girl in kimono, I took inspiration with a kimono I bought in Japan. The panda is more in Chinese style.</description>

      <description>Hello,
Last Tuesday, October 12, was Ada Lovelace Day. Many other artists shared their illustration of Ada Lovelace, as well as a short biography of her. I wanted to share mine as well.
As many said before me, she was a Mathematician and the first person ever to design a computer program when computers didn&amp;rsquo;t even exist, and at a time where it was often believed that women were only interested in &amp;ldquo;futile things&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Hello,
Last weekend, I went to the parc and was happy to see the rich colors autumn is giving to the trees. I collected a few leaves and branches and it inspired me to this painting.</description>

      <description>Hello,
This post continues on the topic of doodling, this time with plants and trees.
Plant and Tree Doodles Again, I started by taking ideas over the web, and collecting doodles.
Composition of tree doodles Now, we can turn those doodles into a unique composition. And voilà!
Transforming photos into doodles We can also browse the web for actual photos of trees and transform them into doodles. This can be very fun too!</description>

      <description>Hello,
Today, I will show a few doodles I did with flowers and plants, with inspirations from web searches and above all from Creations CeeCee&amp;rsquo;s YouTube videos.
Flower Doodles The idea that CeeCee gives (and which I loved) is to make our own booklet of doodles, that we can use later in compositions.

      <description>Hello,
This post will be about frogs :)
Blue dendrobate During a visit to Monaco&amp;rsquo;s zoological garden, I discovered the amazingly blue dendrobate. I then tried to capture it with watercolor ink (which I think I managed quite well ;)).
From real to abstract Being confined at home, I had time to work on improving my drawing skills, and experimented more abstract representations of pictures of animals. So I took my animal encyclopedia and picked the tree frog.</description>

      <description>Hello,
So I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to work on the challenge in the end&amp;hellip; But I did a few more to share. #inktober
No. 5: Blade For this drawing, I found inspiration by looking at images of katana online, and I stumbled upon that photowhich I liked very much.
No.6: Rodent This one was actually rather easy, as I spent quite some time drawing animals and plants from an encyclopedia during the first confinement.</description>

      <description>Hello,
This year, I am doing Inktober, this challenge of making one drawing in ink each day. I thought it would be a good reason to start sharing what I have been doing since I got back to drawing and painting. I am a little late for the challenge, I started only a few days ago, but that does not matter. The idea is to take a month to improve ourselves.</description>
