      <description>Hey!&#xA;I finally finished my pop-up book after 3 years! It took me a lot of time to figure out which buildings I wanted to make pop, and how I was able to do so. But I&amp;rsquo;m super proud and happy of the result!&#xA;Each page shows a place I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in for at least a few weeks: Rouen, Mexico, Madrid, Barcelona, New York State, Tokyo and Nice.</description>

      <description>Hello!&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a few new techniques in watercolor (in particular how to control splatter textures), and I did a painting combining these new techniques.&#xA;With this winter season it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite on the spot!</description>

      <description>Sounds like the title of a fairy tale, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to talk about 2 paintings I made with my new set of iridescent watercolours :).&#xA;The first one is a magpie, one of my favorite birds with its tuxedo-like plumage and its petroleum colours. My previous trials of magpies had not been very satisfying, but I thought this new set of paints were worth making another attempt, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the result!</description>
