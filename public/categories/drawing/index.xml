      <description>Hey there,
I recently took an online class by Laura McKendry, whose style I love and I find so loose and fresh, and for that class I made a couple of drawings about insects. I discovered how much fun they are to paint or draw!
This first one I painted with watercolor the basic shape I wanted to do, and then I drawed with pencils on top.
In this second one, I tried to paint them walking in different directions and to look more lively :)</description>

      <description>Hey!
Here is a small drawing of my cat, whose favorite posture is to lie on the back.
She&amp;rsquo;s often in that weird mood in-between cuddly and psycho-cat, lying a trap full of claws when we try to pet it :)</description>
