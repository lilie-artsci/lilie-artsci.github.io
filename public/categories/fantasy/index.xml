      <description>Sounds like the title of a fairy tale, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to talk about 2 paintings I made with my new set of iridescent watercolours :).&#xA;The first one is a magpie, one of my favorite birds with its tuxedo-like plumage and its petroleum colours. My previous trials of magpies had not been very satisfying, but I thought this new set of paints were worth making another attempt, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the result!</description>
