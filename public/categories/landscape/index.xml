      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been practising lately how to paint landscapes with watercolour, especially sea landscapes. I struggled quite a bit at first, with the colours and the details, but I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with my last attempt.&#xA;Here is the original photo I took for inspiration, taken last April in Carg√®se, Corsica:&#xA;As I mentioned, my first attempts were not very conclusive, especially the second one which I painted on site, I put them here to show the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made over the trials:</description>
