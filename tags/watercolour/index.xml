I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a few new techniques in watercolor (in particular how to control splatter textures), and I did a painting combining these new techniques.
With this winter season it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite on the spot!</description></item><item><title>The Magpie and the Mermaid</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2023/06/the-magpie-and-the-mermaid/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2023/06/the-magpie-and-the-mermaid/</guid><description>Sounds like the title of a fairy tale, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to talk about 2 paintings I made with my new set of iridescent watercolours :).
The first one is a magpie, one of my favorite birds with its tuxedo-like plumage and its petroleum colours. My previous trials of magpies had not been very satisfying, but I thought this new set of paints were worth making another attempt, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the result!</description></item></channel></rss>
