I often like to look at books and encyclopedia on nature to find inspiration.
For this one, I took the inspiration from the picture of a tree in the Serengeti savanna, where a bird called black-capped social weaver likes to make its nest. Many birds do so on the same tree (hence the name &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo;), and the nests look like balls hanging a bit like in a Christmas tree :)</description></item><item><title>Insects</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2022/03/insects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2022/03/insects/</guid><description>Hey there,
I recently took an online class by Laura McKendry, whose style I love and I find so loose and fresh, and for that class I made a couple of drawings about insects. I discovered how much fun they are to paint or draw!
This first one I painted with watercolor the basic shape I wanted to do, and then I drawed with pencils on top.
In this second one, I tried to paint them walking in different directions and to look more lively :)</description></item><item><title>Frogs</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/06/frogs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/06/frogs/</guid><description>Hello,
This post will be about frogs :)
Blue dendrobate During a visit to a zoological garden, I discovered the amazingly blue dendrobate. I then tried to capture it with watercolor ink (which I think I managed quite well ;)).
From real to abstract Being confined at home, I had time to work on improving my drawing skills, and experimented more abstract representations of pictures of animals. So I took my animal encyclopedia and picked the tree frog.</description></item></channel></rss>
