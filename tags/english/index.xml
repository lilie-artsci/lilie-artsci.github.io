I recently took an online class by Laura McKendry, whose style I love and I find so loose and fresh, and for that class I made a couple of drawings about insects. I discovered how much fun they are to paint or draw!
This first one I painted with watercolor the basic shape I wanted to do, and then I drawed with pencils on top.
In this second one, I tried to paint them walking in different directions and to look more lively :)</description></item><item><title>Psycho-cat</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2022/01/psycho-cat/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2022/01/psycho-cat/</guid><description>Hey!
Here is a small drawing of my cat, whose favorite posture is to lie on the back.
She&amp;rsquo;s often in that weird mood in-between cuddly and psycho-cat, lying a trap full of claws when we try to pet it :)</description></item><item><title>Japanese style characters</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/12/japanese-style-characters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/12/japanese-style-characters/</guid><description>Hi there!
A few months ago, I took the Domestika class &amp;ldquo;Watercolor illustration with Japanese influence&amp;rdquo; by Flor Kaneshiro. It inspired me to design the following characters. For the little girl in kimono, I took inspiration with a kimono I bought in Japan. The panda is more in Chinese style.</description></item></channel></rss>
