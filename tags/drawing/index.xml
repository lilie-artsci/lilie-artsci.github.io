These last few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed watching nature being reborn, flowers and trees blooming, taking moments outside feeling the sun on the face&amp;hellip;
And it has inspired me this drawing, while I was sitting on my terrace and watching the plants I have and the neighbours&amp;rsquo; too.
I hope you all enjoy spring time!</description></item><item><title>Doodle sketchbook</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2023/01/doodle-sketchbook/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2023/01/doodle-sketchbook/</guid><description>Hello,
On several of her YouTube&amp;rsquo;s videos, Creations CeeCee gives the very good advice of making doodling sketchbooks. It consits in painting circles or vague shapes when we have remaining paint, and drawing anything that comes to mind on top of it once it&amp;rsquo;s dry.
I tested that, and I really liked having a sketchbook like that always close by. It can be really fun, or relaxing depending on what we draw, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great activity for the kids too!</description></item></channel></rss>
