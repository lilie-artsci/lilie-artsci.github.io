Last Tuesday, October 12, was Ada Lovelace Day. Many other artists shared their illustration of Ada Lovelace, as well as a short biography of her. I wanted to share mine as well.
As many said before me, she was a Mathematician and the first person ever to design a computer program when computers didn&amp;rsquo;t even exist, and at a time where it was often believed that women were only interested in &amp;ldquo;futile things&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
