So I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to work on the challenge in the end&amp;hellip; But I did a few more to share. #inktober
No. 5: Blade For this drawing, I found inspiration by looking at images of katana online, and I stumbled upon that photo which I liked very much.
No.6: Rodent This one was actually rather easy, as I spent quite some time drawing animals and plants from an encyclopedia during the first confinement.</description></item><item><title>Inktober 2020</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2020/10/inktober-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2020/10/inktober-2020/</guid><description>Hello,
This year, I am doing Inktober, this challenge of making one drawing in ink each day. I thought it would be a good reason to start sharing what I have been doing since I got back to drawing and painting. I am a little late for the challenge, I started only a few days ago, but that does not matter. The idea is to take a month to improve ourselves.</description></item></channel></rss>
