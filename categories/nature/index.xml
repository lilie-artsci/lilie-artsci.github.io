I recently took an online class by Laura McKendry, whose style I love and I find so loose and fresh, and for that class I made a couple of drawings about insects. I discovered how much fun they are to paint or draw!
This first one I painted with watercolor the basic shape I wanted to do, and then I drawed with pencils on top.
In this second one, I tried to paint them walking in different directions and to look more lively :)</description></item><item><title>Psycho-cat</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2022/01/psycho-cat/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2022/01/psycho-cat/</guid><description>Hey!
Here is a small drawing of my cat, whose favorite posture is to lie on the back.
She&amp;rsquo;s often in that weird mood in-between cuddly and psycho-cat, lying a trap full of claws when we try to pet it :)</description></item><item><title>Autumn Perfume</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/10/autumn-perfume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/10/autumn-perfume/</guid><description>Hello,
Last weekend, I went to the parc and was happy to see the rich colors autumn is giving to the trees. I collected a few leaves and branches and it inspired me to this painting.</description></item><item><title>Plant and Tree Doodles</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/07/plant-and-tree-doodles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/07/plant-and-tree-doodles/</guid><description>Hello,
This post continues on the topic of doodling, this time with plants and trees.
Plant and Tree Doodles Again, I started by taking ideas over the web, and collecting doodles.
Composition of tree doodles Now, we can turn those doodles into a unique composition. And voilà!
Transforming photos into doodles We can also browse the web for actual photos of trees and transform them into doodles. This can be very fun too!</description></item><item><title>Flower Doodles</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/06/flower-doodles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/06/flower-doodles/</guid><description>Hello,
Today, I will show a few doodles I did with flowers and plants, with inspirations from web searches and above all from Creations CeeCee&amp;rsquo;s YouTube videos.
Flower Doodles The idea that CeeCee gives (and which I loved) is to make our own booklet of doodles, that we can use later in compositions.

This post will be about frogs :)
Blue dendrobate During a visit to a zoological garden, I discovered the amazingly blue dendrobate. I then tried to capture it with watercolor ink (which I think I managed quite well ;)).
From real to abstract Being confined at home, I had time to work on improving my drawing skills, and experimented more abstract representations of pictures of animals. So I took my animal encyclopedia and picked the tree frog.</description></item></channel></rss>
