This post continues on the topic of doodling, this time with plants and trees.
Plant and Tree Doodles Again, I started by taking ideas over the web, and collecting doodles.
Composition of tree doodles Now, we can turn those doodles into a unique composition. And voil√†!
Transforming photos into doodles We can also browse the web for actual photos of trees and transform them into doodles. This can be very fun too!</description></item><item><title>Frogs</title><link>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/06/frogs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lilie-artsci.github.io/2021/06/frogs/</guid><description>Hello,
This post will be about frogs :)
Blue dendrobate During a visit to Monaco&amp;rsquo;s zoological garden, I discovered the amazingly blue dendrobate. I then tried to capture it with watercolor ink (which I think I managed quite well ;)).
From real to abstract Being confined at home, I had time to work on improving my drawing skills, and experimented more abstract representations of pictures of animals. So I took my animal encyclopedia and picked the tree frog.</description></item></channel></rss>
