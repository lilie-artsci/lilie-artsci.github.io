Hello,

This year, I am doing Inktober, this challenge of making one drawing in ink each day. I thought it would be a good reason to start sharing what I have been doing since I got back to drawing and painting.
I am a little late for the challenge, I started only a few days ago, but that does not matter. The idea is to take a month to improve ourselves.

So here are my first drawings for the challenge.


## No. 1: Fish
For this drawing, I actually re-used the model of a fish I did a few weeks ago, while painting and doodling fish and other sea animals, and this one I really liked because I thought it was the more fun. 

I also liked playing with the contrast between black, light grey and red-pink, which turned into a theme over the days.

## No.2: Wisp
The challenge here was more to understand the meaning of the word "wisp" :) (which apparently was an issue for a lot of people doing the challenge, as the organizers had to explain it on the website). I am still not entirely sure I got it right, but here is what it made me think of.

## No.3: Bulky
Here, I took the meaning of thick for yarn. It was much harder than I thought to draw the cat playing, and I made many attempts before doing one I was satisfied with. Turns out, I am really struggling with making cats look realistic, and it looked much better when I tried to make it more simplistic. I still have to work on that...

## No.4: Radio
For this one, I tried to draw a little cubic radio I had when I was a child. I draw this from memory, so it is not really the way it looked. But it still was fun to think about it and draw it.
