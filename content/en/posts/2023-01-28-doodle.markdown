Hello,

On several of her YouTube's videos, [Creations CeeCee](https://www.youtube.com/c/creationsceecee/featured) gives the very good advice of making doodling sketchbooks.
It consits in painting circles or vague shapes when we have remaining paint, and drawing anything that comes to mind on top of it once it's dry.

I tested that, and I really liked having a sketchbook like that always close by.
It can be really fun, or relaxing depending on what we draw, and it's a great activity for the kids too!

Here are some examples of what my daughter and I did:
