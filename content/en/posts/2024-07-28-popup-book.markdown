Hey!

I finally finished my pop-up book after 3 years! It took me a lot of time to figure out which buildings I wanted to make pop, and how I was able to do so.
But I'm super proud and happy of the result!

Each page shows a place I've lived in for at least a few weeks: Rouen, Mexico, Madrid, Barcelona, New York State, Tokyo and Nice.
