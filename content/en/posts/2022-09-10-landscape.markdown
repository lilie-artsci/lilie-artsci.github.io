Hello,

I've been practising lately how to paint landscapes with watercolour, especially sea landscapes. 
I struggled quite a bit at first, with the colours and the details, but I'm quite happy with my last attempt.

Here is the original photo I took for inspiration, taken last April in Carg√®se, Corsica:

As I mentioned, my first attempts were not very conclusive, especially the second one which I painted on site, I put them here to show the progress I've made over the trials:
