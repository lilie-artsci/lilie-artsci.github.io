Hey there,

I recently took an online class by [Laura McKendry](https://lauramckendry.com/), whose style I love and I find so loose and fresh, and for that class
I made a couple of drawings about insects. 
I discovered how much fun they are to paint or draw! 

This first one I painted with watercolor the basic shape I wanted to do, and then I drawed with pencils on top.

In this second one, I tried to paint them walking in different directions and to look more lively :)
