Hello!

These last few weeks, I've enjoyed watching nature being reborn, flowers and trees blooming, taking moments outside feeling the sun on the face... 

And it has inspired me this drawing, while I was sitting on my terrace and watching the plants I have and the neighbours' too. 

I hope you all enjoy spring time!
