Hello,

This post will be about frogs :)

## Blue dendrobate

During a visit to Monaco's zoological garden, I discovered the amazingly blue dendrobate. I then tried to capture it with watercolor ink
(which I think I managed quite well ;)).

## From real to abstract

Being confined at home, I had time to work on improving my drawing skills, and experimented more abstract representations of pictures of animals.
So I took my animal encyclopedia and picked the tree frog.

## Sumi-e style frog

Finally, after being satisfied with my simplified version of the frog, I tried it in Sumi-e style, making as few brush strokes as possible
(on rice paper with black ink).
