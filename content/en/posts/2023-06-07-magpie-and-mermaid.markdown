Sounds like the title of a fairy tale, but I'm actually going to talk about 2 paintings  I made with my new set of iridescent watercolours :).

The first one is a magpie, one of my favorite birds with its tuxedo-like plumage and its petroleum colours. My previous trials of magpies had not been very satisfying, but I thought this new set of paints were worth making another attempt, and I'm quite happy with the result!
The bottom picture was taken with flash to show the iridescent colours.

This second painting is four-hand piece of art I did with my daughter :). Funnily, when she saw the drawing she asked why I had drawned the mermaid with a T-shirt. 
That's a good point, I just don't like shell bras, but what do mermaids wear when they go out?

I also like the results, we had fun making it!
