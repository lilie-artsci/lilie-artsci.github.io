Hello!

I've been working on a pop-up book of the places I've lived in, for the Domestika class by [Sylvia Hijano](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/958-pop-up-book-creation), which I'm really enjoying!

I just finished a page on Nice, France, where I spent around 8 years. Here are the details of the page.

Cimiez neighborhood, which is the area near which I used to live, with the roman arena, the Matisse museum and the monastery:

And here is the Negresco, a luxuary hotel near the beach (the lines are for the popup folding):
