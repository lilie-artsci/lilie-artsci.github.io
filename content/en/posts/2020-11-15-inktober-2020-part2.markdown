Hello,

So I didn't have much time to work on the challenge in the end... But I did a few more to share.
#inktober

## No. 5: Blade
For this drawing, I found inspiration by looking at images of katana online, 
and I stumbled upon that <a href="https://wallhere.com/en/wallpaper/242218">photo</a> which I liked very much.

## No.6: Rodent

This one was actually rather easy, as I spent quite some time drawing animals and plants from an encyclopedia during the first confinement.

## No.7: Fancy
That one is completely original. 
I was struggling at first with finding a good idea to represent the word, I didn't want to draw the easy guy in a fancy suit, 007-style. 
But then my partner mention the idea of drawing something we don't typically figure as fancy, like ugly monsters. 
I was not completely on board with that, but it made me think, and I started just drawing this funny bird. 
I drew it directly in ink in a sketchbook, and as I couldn't manage to redo it as nice I ended up cutting/pasting it on a blank card.

## No.8: Teeth
I started looking at pictures of smiles and practiced that for a few drawings (which I really liked cause I never managed to draw teeth in smiles well before), 
but then I thought I would very much like to do something else. 
I hesitated between the jaw of a mega-shark, that I saw at <a href="https://churaumi.okinawa/en/">Okinawa's Churaumi Aquarium</a>, and a saber toothed cat, which I find fascinating too.
I chose the latter one, only because I couldn't really find a nice picture of the former in my photo album nor online... 
The original picture is on the Wikipedia's page of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Smilodon_head.jpg#/media/File:Smilodon_head.jpg">Smilodon</a>.

## No.10: Hope
This one looks simple, but it actually took me some time to train both for the clouds and the rainbow. 
The rainbow was indeed the toughest, because the yellow would get mixed almost completely with the other colours.

I actually never drew no. 9 (throw) nor the other ones, many of them did not inspire much and I found it difficult to find time every day for that.
