Hello,

Today, I will show a few doodles I did with flowers and plants, with inspirations from web searches and above all from 
[Creations CeeCee's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/creationsceecee/featured).

# Flower Doodles

The idea that CeeCee gives (and which I loved) is to make our own booklet of doodles, 
that we can use later in compositions.

# Composition of flower doodles

Now, we can turn those doodles into a unique composition. And voil√†!
