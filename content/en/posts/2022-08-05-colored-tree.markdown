Hello,

I often like to look at books and encyclopedia on nature to find inspiration.

For this one, I took the inspiration from the picture of a tree in the Serengeti savanna, where a bird called **black-capped social weaver** likes to make its nest.
Many birds do so on the same tree (hence the name "social"), and the nests look like balls hanging a bit like in a Christmas tree :) 

I really like this picture, and I turned it into a colored tree to play with watercolor and acrylic inks and with cotton buds.
