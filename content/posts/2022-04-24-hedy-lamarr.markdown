Hey there,

This month, [ONU Femmes France](https://www.onufemmes.fr/) celebrates a fascinating woman. 
We all know her face, we've seen her since childhood, but few of us know her name.
I give you: **Hedy Lamarr**, the woman who inspired Disney's Snow White.

She was an Austrian actress and movie producer, and was considered the most beautiful woman.
But the reason I want to talk about her today is that she was also an **inventor**.
Her most famous legacy is a patent called "Secret Communications System" she filed in 1942 and co-invented with composer George Antheil.
It consists in the design of a frequency hopping spread spectrum method (FHSS), which she came up with during World War II in a spirit of enabling communication without being eavesdropped or jammed, by switching the frequency on which a signal was being emitted to another frequency in a sequence known by the transmitter and receiver.
FHSS are know being used in wireless networks, such as Bluetooth.

Check out her [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr#Inventor) to know more about her!
