Hello,

Last Tuesday, October 12, was **Ada Lovelace Day**. 
Many other artists shared their illustration of Ada Lovelace, as well as a short biography of her. 
I wanted to share mine as well. 

As many said before me, she was a Mathematician and the first **person** ever to design a computer program when computers didn't even exist, and at a time 
where it was often believed that women were only interested in "futile things".

As a woman in science, Ada Lovelace represents a great role model for me and one of the proofs that women can excel in maths and computer science. 
I think it is a shame that I never heard of her up until a few years ago, not in highschool and not at the university... 
I only heard of her when I started to come upon the story of other women that played a great role too in the development of science.
I hope schoolbooks will start telling her story and that of other women soon, if it's not already the case.

This is the first illustration of a series about **Women in Science**, and about how successful collaborations between women and men resulted in leaps in technology.
