Hi there!

A few months ago, I took the Domestika class ["Watercolor illustration with Japanese influence"](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/617-watercolor-illustration-with-japanese-influence/course) 
by [Flor Kaneshiro](https://florkaneshiro.com/).
It inspired me to design the following characters. 
For the little girl in kimono, I took inspiration with a kimono I bought in Japan.
The panda is more in Chinese style.
